# TLDR on Contributing

There's no code of conduct, nor is there a long and structured guide on how to contribute. There's just a few bullet points to keep in mind when making contributions:

- There is no token.
- "Fix README" PRs will not be merged. Please contribute something useful.
- Prefer creating issues before PRs, unless something is really that small/time-sensitive.
